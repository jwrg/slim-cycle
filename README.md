# SLiM-cycle
This is just a simple slim theme that comes with more than one wallpaper and a 
script that changes the background for the next login.

The script, cycle.sh, requires root permission if the theme is owned by root
or in a location owned by root (duh).  To randomize the background the theme
will use on the next login, run the script on login using .xinitrc or whatever
script run at login that you prefer.

All photographs were taken by myself.  Therefore I hold the copyright on all
photographs found in this theme; please don't reuse them without my permission
(it's illegal and not very nice).

The script, cycle.sh, is licensed as GPLv3.
